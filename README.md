# My-React-Portfolio

## Description

A personal portfolio web application built with React and Vite. It showcases selected frontend and CLI projects, along with a contact form and resume download feature. The design uses a clean modern UI with an abstract background and a dark color palette.

- **Motivation:** To build a professional portfolio showcasing projects and skills while practicing frontend development.
- **Purpose:** To demonstrate proficiency in React, Vite, and modern web styling for job-seeking and self-branding.
- **Problem Solved:** Consolidates key projects and contact methods into one professional landing page.
- **What I Learned:** React components, CSS layout with custom design systems, Vite tooling, Netlify deployment, and responsive design strategies.
