           Hi! I'm <strong>Luna Houshmand</strong>, a passionate web developer with a background in QA automation.
           I'm currently transitioning into frontend development using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vite</strong>,
           and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
           </p>

           <p>
           I love solving problems, building clean user interfaces, and constantly learning new technologies.
           My approach to development is rooted in curiosity, collaboration, and the drive to build intuitive, impactful digital experiences.
           </p>

           <p>
           I'm a results-driven <strong>Software QA Engineer</strong> with a proven track record of collaborating closely
           with development teams to deliver robust, high-quality applications that align with both business goals and user needs.
           I have hands-on experience designing and maintaining UI and API automation frameworks that streamline workflows
           and ensure consistent testing coverage.
           </p>

           <p>
           I'm skilled at identifying and documenting defects, implementing effective solutions, and ensuring efficient test
           execution to meet fast-paced project deadlines. As I shift into frontend development, I bring a unique perspective
           rooted in <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>detail</strong>, and <strong>user experience</strong>â€”aiming to build
           applications that not only work great, but also feel great to use.
           </p>
